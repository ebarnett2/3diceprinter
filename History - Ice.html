  <h1><em><strong>The  History of Ice Construction</strong></em></h1>
  <p>Even a swift analysis of the history of  construction with ice and snow reveals many explorations of the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition" target="_blank">phase  change</a> in architecture and engineering.  The following subjects do not represent the complete list of  past and current ice construction techniques and practices, yet they have served as references and lessons for our research and concept development.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Vernacular Architecture</u></strong><br />
  Globally, environments in  which sub-zero temperatures are relatively common have always been conducive to  the construction of snow and ice structures at varying scales. More  specifically, North American snow-dwelling  building techniques have instilled a deeply rooted relationship between ice structures  and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular_architecture" target="_blank">vernacular architecture</a>. The most recognizable is the Inuit <em>igloo</em> - a shelter made of cut blocks of  ice or packed snow, stacked in a spiral pattern to form a half-sphere. These architectural  structures, however temporary in the short-term, have allowed the Inuit to  prosper in an extreme climate for many centuries. Yet, the limits of ice and  snow in construction have been explored in a myriad of ways, from fantastical  ice palaces, to ice-composite naval air-craft carriers.</p>

  <p><strong><u>Ice Palaces and the Ice Hotel</u></strong><br />
  Historically, ice palaces and  hotels  are large, breathtaking buildings constructed out of ice and packed snow. In  1740, the first ice palace is said to have been built in Russia as the  cruel setting for the wedding night of a newlywed couple who had angered the  Empress Anna Ivanovna. Designed  by the architect Pyotr Yeropkin, it consisted of huge ice blocks which were  frozen together with water and measured 20 meters tall and 50 meters wide. More  recent ice palaces have had much less sinister connotations. In second half of  the 19th Century, several palaces were built as the centerpieces of  popular Scandinavian and North American winter festivals, where they provided  the setting for many of the festival's events and generated employmentfor those in need of it. </p>

<p>These architectural marvels glorified North America's winter  wonderland and set the foundation for what has become a major tourist  attraction. Currently, the ice hotel industry is generating international acclaim  and attracts tourists who are interested in novelties and unusual environments.  For instance, in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada, a modern version of the ice hotel is erected  every January. It is built with an average of 5000 tons of sculpted ice and  15000 tons of snow. The smooth walls of the vaulted rooms are cast snow, approximately 4 feet wide, while immense blocks of sculpted ice serve as furniture. </p>

  <p><strong><u>International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival - Harbin, China</u></strong><br/>
  Since 1963, when the festival was first established, the snow and ice  structures being built have  become increasingly adventurous and complex. Located in the north-eastern region of China, Harbin's cold  climate benefits from the winter winds originating in Siberia. In 2007, the Canadian themed event, in memoriam of Norman Bethune, included a Guinness  World Record for the largest snow sculpture which stood at 250 metres long, 9 meters high, and which was built with over 13 000 cubic metres of snow. </p>

  <p><strong><u>Project Habakkuk  </u></strong><br />
 While  ice seems like a  natural construction material for a northern climate, the military has adapted  ice for several other uses as well. One such application is the use of packed  snow and ice as a paving material for roads in the far north, where traditional  road materials would be inappropriate and expensive. Another particularly  unique experiment was <em>Project</em> <em>Habakkuk</em>, proposed by the British navy  in 1942. At this point, the UK had been stripped of ship-building materials and  as a last resort, the government turned to experimentation with ice because of  its inherent buoyancy. Thus, the plans for a naval vessel the size of an  aircraft carrier were developed and even partially built using a material called <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pykrete" target="_blank">pykrete</a></em>, a mixture of frozen  water and woodpulp. Finally, due to problems  with long-term durability, the enormous production resources needed, and the conclusion of  the war, the project never set sail, yet to this day it remains a fascinating study  of ice-based structures and construction techniques applicable to civil and  military milieus alike.

  <p><strong><u>Harnessing the phase change properties of ice</u></strong><br />
  More recently, new advantages of  employing ice, not as a building material, but for its phase transition abilities  are surfacing and generating major interest throughout the globe. For instance,  it has been suggested that bulk freezing may provide a way to store water in  the form of ice in winter and use the melted water in summer for irrigation in  dry areas around the world. Another fascinating by-product of this process will  be the free cooling potential in summer from the phase-change energy released. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of ice and snow as  building materials for traditional construction techniques has been extensively researched and tested. At McGill, we are developing automated, robot-assisted techniques for harnessing the properties of  water-to-ice phase change. We have concentrated on additive processes like rapid prototyping, partly because subtractive methods like CNC are already well-developed. Additionally, using RP, we will be able to build certain parts that cannot be built using CNC.</p>
